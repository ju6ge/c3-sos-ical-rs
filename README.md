==============

This script does not win any awards for beautiful code, it was quickly hacked together to get a faster way to import self organized sessions for c3 into my calendar.

Feel free to use and modify as you see fit 

## Usage

``` sh
cargo run -- --url "https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/event/detail/<name>" --output meetup.ics
```
